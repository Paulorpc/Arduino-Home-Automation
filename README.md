# Arduino-Home-Automation
Arduino Home Automation with a local Webserver and Mysql Database

The main objective of this projetc is to present a home automation system for engineering educational projects. It is based on Arduino micro-controller acting as central system and electrical interface with residential devices to perform control tasks. Domotics is an important field that shall become soon part of most engineer graduation. It provides convenience, economy, and safety for residences integrated into new technologies in a more connected and intelligent environment. This work presents a three phases procedure to control electrical and electronic devices via a website that can be accessed by computers or mobile devices such as smart-phones and tablets that are, a web page to allow user interaction and control, the Arduino microcontroller hardware that act as the central system and the electrical interface of residential devices. The proposal is to provide a low cost and yet efficient and safe process for projects development.
